          In the depths of tidal sands, they hide,
          Geoducks, the giants of the bivalve tide.
          With shells as humble as the dusk's last light,
          Yet their necks extend, a wondrous sight.
          
          Beneath the waves where ocean meets the shore,
          In silent patience, they burrow and explore.
          Their siphons stretch, like whispers in the sea,
          Drawing life from currents, wild and free.
          
          Ancient dwellers of the murky brine,
          Their form a marvel, crafted by design.
          Unseen by many, yet they flourish there,
          In hidden coves, with tender, oceanic care.
          
          Their beauty lies not in the outer shell,
          But in the mystery they quietly tell.
          Of epochs passed, of waters wide and deep,
          Where secrets of the seabed softly sleep.
          
          Oh, geoducks, you titans of the sand,
          Anchored steadfast in your underwater land.
          In your quiet grace, a story does unfold,
          Of nature's wisdom, and treasures untold.
