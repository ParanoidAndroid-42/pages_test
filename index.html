          In kitchen corners, steel and hums reside,
          Where dishes clean, and suds in spirals glide.
          Yet in the depths of briny ocean's sweep,
          A curious thought stirs from the deep.
          
          Do geoducks dream of dishwashers' embrace,
          With cycles warm, a cleansing, steamy grace?
          Their siphons, long and reaching for the tide,
          Might whisper wishes of a rinse, worldwide.
          
          For in the muck where gritty sands persist,
          A life of grit and silt they can’t resist.
          But oh, to feel the water’s pulsing spray,
          A dishwasher’s dance to wash the grime away.
          
          No more the salty crust upon their shell,
          In sudsy swirls, they'd find a freshened swell.
          Imagined joys of bubbles soft and clear,
          A fantasy of clean, both far and near.
          
          Yet geoducks remain in tidal beds,
          Where ocean waves caress their sturdy heads.
          The dishwasher, a far-off, shiny dream,
          A fanciful, aquatic-themed regime.
          
          For now, they stay in nature's gentle hold,
          Their siphons stretching through the waters cold.
          Dreams of dishwashers left to tides and sands,
          While life unfolds in briny, wet demands.
